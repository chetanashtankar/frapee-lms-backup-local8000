Great question, Chetan! Since youâ€™re working with the Frappe LMS, which is a frontend app based on Frappe + Vite + Vue3, here's how you can safely modify files like index.css and main.js and understand their structure and workflow.

âœ… 1. Location of Files (Path)
In the Frappe LMS repo (https://github.com/frappe/lms.git), your frontend code is typically located in this folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
~/frappe-bench/apps/lms/frontend/src/
Inside this src/ folder, you will find:

main.js â†’ This is the entry point of your Vue app.

index.css â†’ This file contains global CSS for your frontend.

components/, pages/ â†’ Your Vue components and routes.

âœ… 2. How it works (Basic Flow)
The frontend in Frappe LMS uses Vite for bundling. When you run:

bash
Copy
Edit
bench build
or when the frontend is being used in development mode with:

bash
Copy
Edit
bench start
It compiles the src/main.js, includes your index.css, and generates the final JS/CSS files that your LMS website uses.

âœ… 3. How to Modify and Apply Changes
âœ” Steps to Modify:
Open files you want to edit:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano ~/frappe-bench/apps/lms/frontend/src/index.css
nano ~/frappe-bench/apps/lms/frontend/src/main.js
Make your changes and save.

âœ” Apply Changes:
Now, to reflect your changes:

If you are in production mode:

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench build
sudo supervisorctl restart all
This will:

Rebuild frontend assets.

Restart all services to reflect the new frontend.

If you are in development mode with bench start, it hot-reloads, so just refreshing the page is enough.

âœ… 4. Quick Recap Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd ~/frappe-bench/apps/lms/frontend/src

# Edit main.js and index.css
nano main.js
nano index.css

# Go to frappe-bench and build assets
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench build

# Restart server (only in production)
sudo supervisorctl restart all
ðŸ”„ Important Notes:
Yes, in production, you MUST rebuild and restart after changes.

No, you donâ€™t need to restart in development (bench start handles it automatically).

Always check logs if something breaks:

bash
Copy
Edit
tail -f /home/frappe/frappe-bench/logs/web.log
